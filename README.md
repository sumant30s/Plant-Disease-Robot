# 🌱 AI-Powered Disease Detection & Precision Pesticide Spraying Robot

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a smart agriculture robot that can detect plant diseases in real time and spray pesticide only where required. The system combines AI, IoT, and robotics to support precision farming and reduce manual effort in agriculture.

The robot continuously monitors crops using a camera and machine learning model. When a disease is detected, it activates a targeted spraying system. The robot can work in both autonomous and manual modes and provides live monitoring through a web dashboard.

This solution helps farmers reduce pesticide usage, improve crop health, and adopt modern smart farming techniques.
